># Elastic Cloud Compute
* Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2)
* EC2 is a service that you can able to deploy application in the cloud and can able to configure security and networking and manage the instances in the Virtual server that is provided by AWS.
* Without the need of the physical hardware , you can use EC2 to run your applications in a virtual machine.
* That virtual machine is maintained by cloud provider (like AWS, Azure, GCP, Alibaba, etc.) and managed by Elasticsearch Operations(EO).
* This is flexible and scalable cloud service that allows users to launch AWS resources on-demand, sitting anywhere in the world

># Usage
* By using EC2 we can able to reduce the cost for the hardware
* We can create many EC2 instances (instance is nothing but a virtual server) according to our requirements and usage.
* We can Scale up (increase capacity or resources) the EC2 instance when the traffic is high in the server and scale down(decrease capacity) when there are no requests on the application.
* For example,
    - During the vacation time the online train booking will experience high demand and long loading time because they use on-premise it will give the high performance to its limit even though it will give only slow booking 
    - To avoid this they can use  Amazon's EC2 service which provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Users can obtain a efficient service even in the vacation time
    - The server will scale up if it experience high demand and scale down when there is low demand in booking ticket


* Pay only for what you use, no upfront costs or long-term contracts required.
* You have full control over your instances: choose the number and type of instances that best fit your application's needs.

># Features of EC2
### Instances
    - Every Instance we create is completely run in virtual environment
### Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)
    - AMI are nothing but it is the required components which is used to start and run and access the server

    - AMI includes Operating System and the additional software that are used to run the server
### Instance Types
    - We can able to choose which type of instance we want to use based on our requirement like CPU power, memory etc.,

    - Virtual servers with different characteristics such as CPU speed, memory size etc.,

    - It helps us to choose the best instance type based on our requirements

### Key pairs
    -While initializing EC2 we should create a public key and a private key

    - Secure login information for your instances. AWS stores the public key and you store the private key in a secure place.
