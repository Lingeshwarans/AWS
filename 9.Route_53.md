Hey folks today we will see about the Route 53
># What is Route 53
* Basically Route 53 provide DNS as a Service
* DNS(Domain Name System)
### What is DNS?
* Amazon.com , Google.com , Etc... These are some of the domain name.

* If you searched for **amazon.com** the request goes to the server and it returns the request. But before this process after sending the request the DNS resolver will find the IP address of the domain name and send the request to the specified Domain.
### Brief:
* Every server has its IP address of its own. We can able to communicate using IP address But , Domain names are human readable and easy to remember rather than IP addresses. So, for this reason we map the IP address of any server to a domain name.

* When you register a domain, you get an IP address associated with it.
* If someone types "www.amazon.com" into their browser and hits enter, the computer will look up the IP address associated with "www.amazon.com" and connect to the nearest CDN(Content Delivery Network) or Server.
* Route 53 makes it easy for developers and businesses to set up websites, direct traffic to applications, work with shared hosting providers, control the routing of HTTPS traffic.
* If your website or application becomes popular and has lots of traffic, this IP may change.
* So to keep track of which IP should be shown when someone types in www.example.com they use DNS servers.
* DNS servers are like phone directories for IP addresses. They map domain names to IP addresses.

## Route 53
* AWS provides Route 53 for DNS(Domain Name System) service.
* The request before entering into the Load Balancer  goes through the Route 53 first.
* It's very simple to setup and manage. You just need to add records to the hosted zone.
* There are two type of record sets :
  * A type : It maps a domain to an IP address.
  * CNAME : It maps one domain to another domain.
* For example if you have www.example.com mapped to IP X.X.X.X then cname can be used to map subdomain like app1.www.example. (www.example1.com -> www.example2.com )

#### Let's create a Hosted Zone & Add Record Set.
1. Go to `Route 53` from AWS Management Console.

2. Click on `Create Hosted Zone`.
3. Enter the Domain Name i.e., example.com .
4. Select `Public hostded zone` .
5. Click `Create`.
6. Now click on `Go To Records`.
7. Here you can see `Record Sets`, where you can add new records.
8. Click `Add Record`.
9. In `Name*` field enter `@` (This represents the root of the domain).
10. In `Type*` select `A - IPv4 address`.
11. Copy the Public IP Address of EC2 instance and paste it in Value*.
12. Leave other fields as default.
13. Click `Save`.

Now if anyone tries to access http://www.example.com they would be redirected to the IP mentioned in the value field.

Now if anyone tries to access http://www.example.com they would be redirected to the IP mentioned in the value field.

* We can able to purchase domain names from any 3rd party  registrars.

* Aws also sells Domain Names.
* if the Domain name is purchased outsode of the AWS then we should add Hosted Zones
* We should create Hosted Zones for both if we buy the domain from AWS or outside.
* First the request will go to the *Hosted Zones* then will search the *DNS record* if it is found then Route 53 will resolve your Domain name to IP Address and the request go ahead.


### Other use of Route 53
* Apart from creating Domain registration and Hosted Zones it can able to do Health Checks.
* Health Check - If there are more than one hosted server for an application Route 53  can monitor the health of the server and route the traffic accordingly.
