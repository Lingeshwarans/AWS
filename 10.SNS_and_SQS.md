Today we are going to see about SNS and SQS services in AWS.

# SQS

* SQS-Simple Queue Service
* In simple words it can be said as "It is a queue where all the messages will wait until it is picked by someone" 
* using this Amazon SQS  we can send messages, recieve messages, between software components without Losing messages.
* It will push the messages to a queue.
* If there is no consumer for that message, it will be kept in the queue until someone takes it up.
* Message retention period: 14 days (can extend upto 15 days).
    * After this time, the message will be deleted from the system. 
* Maximum message size: 256 KB.
* Number of messages can be sent per second: 3000.
* A single URL can contain 1000 messages.
* There is no limit on how many URLs. 
* The number of requests can go beyond the rate limit as long as you don't exceed the total request count per second.
* Messages are delivered in order as they were added to the queue.

    -In Amazon SQS an application sends an message to a queue.
    An user or a service will retrieve this message from the queue and then delete from the queue.

# SNS
![](https://thebackroomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/amazon-sns-ft.png)
* SNS â€“ Simple Notification Service
* It is a publish/subscribe messaging service.
* A publisher publishes a message to the subscriber.
* Subscribers receive notifications when something happens.
* The event source is called a topic.
* Topic is just a container for events.
* You can have multiple topics with one subscription.
* Each event source has its own set of protocols like HTTP/HTTPS, Email, SMS etc.

**Types of Protocols supported by SNS**
## 1. Http / Https 

 This allows you to send notification through any REST API compatible web server.
## 2. Email
 This allows you to send emails using SMTP.
## 3. SMS
 This allows you you to send text messages via an SMPP server.
## 4. SQS
 This allows you to enqueue a message to another queue within your account.
## 5. Application
 This allows you to write custom code to handle the notification.

**Concept of Endpoint & Protocol in SNS**
An endpoint is essentially where the notification is being sent to.
A protocol tells AWS which type of endpoint it  should deliver the notification to.

**How does SNS work?**
1. Publish a message to a topic.
2. SNS determines what type of endpoints are associated with that topic.
3. For each type of endpoint, it delivers the message accordingly.

**Retry Policy**

* If there is some failure while sending the notification, SNS retries delivery up to 15 times over a period of 15 minutes
* If there is some error while sending the notification, SNS keeps retrying until the message is successfully delivered or the retries are exhausted.
