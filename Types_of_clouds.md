There are Five types of Clouds.
* Public 
* Private
* Hybrid
* Community
* Multi-cloud.


># Public Cloud
In the public cloud, the user will not buy any hardware or software, they just need to pay to use it.

For example(Amazon Web Service(AWS),Google cloud platform(GCP), Microsoft Azure)

In this public cloud, the infrastructures will be provided by the service providers. The user needs to pay for the resources that they are using.
***

* It is highly scalable.
* Comparatively Low cost.
* There are many number of services provided by the Cloud provider.
* No upfront investment required.
* The service can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection.
* Security is maintained by the cloud providers.
***
># Private cloud
The private cloud is owned and operated by a single organization or entity. In this type of cloud, only authorized users have access to resources.
***
* Only the selected users can access
* Hardware and Software are owned by the organization/user.
* Cost is higher than the public cloud as you have to purchase your own hardware and software.
* Limited number of resources compared to a public cloud.
* More control over infrastructure.
* Customization options available.
* Can be more secure if implemented properly.
***

># Hybrid cloud
Hybrid cloud combines both private and public cloud.
The businesses that cannot completely shift to either public or private cloud may opt for hybrid cloud where some applications run on private cloud while others run on public cloud.

***
* Selected users
* Uses both on-premise data center and cloud resources.
* Offers advantages of both worlds.
* Flexibility in terms of selecting which components to run in the cloud and which to keep on premises.

># Community cloud
Community clouds are open source projects that allow multiple organizations to collaborate on building and operating a shared resource

***

* Accesses by organization members
* Shared resources among multiple organizations 
* Resources are managed by a community of operators who maintain the underlying infrastructure.
***
># Multi cloud
A multi-cloud environment allows an organization to leverage resources across multiple public clouds, such as
Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and IBM Cloud. This approach provides greater flexibility and capacity for businesses that need to operate in multiple cloud platforms
***
* Accessed by multiple organizations
* Allows sharing of resources without having to manage them individually.
* Cost vary based on usage patterns.
***
