This post maybe the Continuation of the previous post.

In todays post let us see about the **NACL** and **Security  Groups** in AWS.
**This is the basic Security practice in AWS**

># Basic Info
 ### Subnet - A range of IP address in VPC
 ### Internet Gateway - Allows traffic inside the VPC
 ### Load Balancer - Have access to the private subnet.
 ### Public subnet - Connect directly use the Internet getaway.
 ###  Private subnet - No direct connection with internet, but can be accessed by load balancers or instances that are connected to a NAT gateway.

># Security
- In AWS, Security is a shared responsibility.

- It's not just about protecting your data but also making sure that you are not giving too much access to others. It's not just one side that needs to be secured. Both sides need to take care It means that you are responsible for security but AWS also provides services which can help with it.
- We can add Securities like Security Groups, NACL, API gateway.
- These are provided by AWS, Here DevOps engineer plays a role, like which type of security should be given to the VPC?
SG(Security Group) & NACL are the last line of defense for security.

># Security Groups
- Virtual Firewall that acts as a filter for incoming/outgoing network traffic in your EC2 instances.

-  It controls the flow of traffic into and out of each instance separately.
-  Security Groups are stateful. If any rule allows traffic in then it will allow responses also.

### How SG works?
1. When an Instance starts up, it gets assigned a default SG which has full egress (Outbound) but no ingress (Inbound).

1. When an instance starts up, it gets assigned a default security group (sg-xxxxxx).
2. The default sg contains only one rule which allows all traffic from anywhere.
3. You cannot modify this default security group. But you can create new ones.
4. Each security group resides in only one VPC.
5. An instance can belong to multiple security groups.
6. Rules in a security group must be unique within the group.
7. There is no limit on how many rules you can have in a security group.
8. As soon as you remove the default security group from an instance, it becomes part of the VPC's default security group.
8. As soon as you remove the default security group from an instance, it loses all its permissions.
9. To stop all Instance communication, simply remove the default security group.

### Ports vs Protocols:
* Ports define the specific endpoints at which traffic arrives or departs.

* Protocols define what kind of traffic is allowed through those ports.

* DevOps engineer should be carefull when declaring a port number and that port number should be well-secured.
* By default Except for the Port 25, AWS allows all the outbound traffic.

* By default all the inbound traffic will be denied by aws.

## Inside SG
* Inbound Traffic
* Outbound Traffic

For Example,
* If the user wants to access an application which is inside the VPC is called inbound traffic.

* When the application inside the VPC tries to communicate, with a 3rd party application is called outbound traffic.
* We can able to manage both the traffic manually.

## Port 25
* Port 25 is a SMPT port(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)

* It is used by the mail servers to send emails.
* To stop the spam activities in the vpc we need to block the port 25.
* And also IP adderss of the EC2 instance or the IP address of the aplication should not be recorded in that port.
* so by default AWS aill block the port 25.


># NACL
* A Network Access Control List (NACL) is a set of rules that control the flow of network traffic into and out of your VPC. A single NACL can contain several rules.

* Security Groups is applied at the EC2 instances level.
* Network Access Control Lists (NACL) are applied at the subnet level.
* For Example,
* if the EC2 instance SG allows all the traffic by a mistake then hacker can able to enter the EC2 Instance easily.
* Consider if there is 50 ec2 instances and each has a security group in that some EC2 will allow all traffic by a mistake If you want to restrict the traffic then NACL rules come into play
* Where you can define some type of rules  that allow/deny certain IP addresses and ports to communicate with your resources.
* If NACL is defined by some rules then EC2  instances will not get any incoming request unless and until that rule permits the request.
* Because NACL is the upper layer security of the EC2  instances.

* Instead of adding SG to all the instances Only one NACL is enough for all the EC2 inside that Subnet.

Thats it about the Security groups and NACLs.
