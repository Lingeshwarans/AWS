### Hi hello and welcome back to by blog

And in this post, We will talk about the most important thing that you need to know about IAM (Identity Access Management) in AWS. 

># What is IAM
* IAM stands for Identity and Access Management (IAM).
* It's a service that helps you manage access to your AWS With limited resource. 


>## Shared access to your AWS account
* You can grant other people permission to administer and use resources in your AWS account without having to share your password or access key.
    - The allowed person can able to access only the limited resource that are assigned to them
    - It is basically for the convenience of the user and also for the account holder.
    - he can assign  permissions to users, groups or roles so they can perform specific tasks in his/her name.
    - For ex if the IAM user is allowed to access the EC2 instance and he wants to access the S3 bucket then he can't do that without the permission of the account holder.
    * let's discuss about Those services in future ...ðŸ”°ðŸ˜Š

>## How to access the iam account 
* If you creating an  IAM User then it will ask for ACCESS KEY ID & SECRET ACCESS KEY which we need to use while accessing the aws console from browser and the AWS Account holder will have the KEY ID & SECRET ACCESS KEY.

* If you are working in a company as an intern or an fresher or new to this job will definitely have an access to the AWS services with an IAM account only for the security practices
because they may not know all the services. To help them understand and get experience on that field.
***

* You can't sign in as a group. You can use groups to specify permissions for multiple users at a time. Groups make permissions easier to manage for large sets of users. For example, you could have a group named IAMAdmins and give that group permissions to administer IAM resources.


># Policies and Permission

**You grant permissions to a user by creating a policy, which is a document that lists the actions that a user can perform and the resources those actions can affect. Any actions or resources that are not explicitly allowed are denied by default. Policies can be created and attached to principals (users, groups of users, roles assumed by users, and resources).**

- In IAM, everything starts with policies.

- A policy is an entity that defines what permissions are available to users, groups, or roles within Templates.

- You can able to give the policy to a individual IAM or an IAM group 

- IAM group is nothing but a collection a IAM users.

- Instead of giving every individual the same policy, you can create a group and add people who need the same policy in the company.

-  It will be effective for everyone who is in the group
