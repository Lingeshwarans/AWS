Hello Everyone In this post lets see about the VPC-Virtual Private Cloud

># Virtual Private Cloud
* It is build inside the AWS Datacenter.

* We can create this VPC in any region of our choice.
* It is build and maintained by DevOps or AWS DevOps engineer.
* While creating VPC it will ask to create  a CIDR block, which is IP address range for that particular VPC.
* Once VPC is created then we need to launch an instance in this VPC.
* VPC is a virtual network within the AWS cloud platform.

># Inside the VPC
* We can create many number of internal subnets inside the VPC.

* Each Subnet has its own set of IP addresses.
* The IP Addresses are assigned automatically from the CIDR Block.

* Inside each subnet we can create any number of  resources like EC2 instances , RDS databases etc....

* There is gateway  attached with every VPC which acts as a bridge between your VPC and Internet.

* To make sure that our application is accessible over internet we have to attach IGW (Internet Gateway) to the VPC.

* We can attach multiple gateway to a single VPC.

*the internet gateway is called as public sub net because it allows access to the internet.

* If you don't want your resource to be accessible over the internet then you have to detach the internet gateway from that specific subnet.

* If you want to restrict the access to only specific services/ports then you have to use Network Access Control List (NACL). 

* If you want to restrict the access to only specific services/ports then you have to use Network Access Control List (NACL).

    - After the connection to the internet with  the help of IGW (Internet Gateway) you can assign security groups to control the traffic.
    - Before that if a user wants to communicate with the server  he needs to send request through IGW (Internet Gateway).
    - Then the request from the user will go through the load balancer or elastic Load balancer (ELB) .
    - Then the request will reach the router or route table which directs the traffic to appropriate destination.
    - ELB does'nt know where to send the request so it distributes the requests with the help of route tables
    - After that the request goes to the application server(EC2).
    - Before entering into  the app server the request will be checked by security groups.
      * Security group is nothing but a filter which helps us to control who can come into our system and what they can do once they reach there.

># What if the server inside the VPC need to access the Internet
* To allow the servers inside the VPC to communicate with the Internet you have two options:
