Hello Everyone In this post lets see about the VPC-Virtual Private Cloud

># Virtual Private Cloud
* It is build inside the AWS Datacenter.
* We can create this VPC in any region of our choice.
* It is build and maintained by DevOps or AWS DevOps engineer.
* While creating VPC it will ask to create  a CIDR block, which is IP address range for that particular VPC.
    * Example: 10.0.0.0/24 (IPV4) - This means we are assigning 16 addresses from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.0.15.
              The /24 represents how many bits are used up for the network ID and how many bits are left for host IDs. Here its 8 bits so maximum hosts available = 2^
              So, total number of addresses available = 2^8 â€“ 2 = 254 devices can connect at a time.
* Once VPC is created then we need to launch an instance into this VPC.
* VPC is a virtual network within the AWS cloud platform.
